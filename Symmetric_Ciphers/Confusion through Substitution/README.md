The first step of each AES round is SubBytes. This involves taking each byte of the state matrix and substituting it for a different byte in a preset 16x16 lookup table. The lookup table is called a "Substitution box" or "S-box" for short, and can be perplexing at first sight. Let's break it down.


If a cipher has poor confusion, it is possible to express a relationship between ciphertext, key, and plaintext as a linear function. For instance, in a Caesar cipher, ciphertext = plaintext + key. That's an obvious relation, which is easy to reverse. More complicated linear transformations can be solved using techniques like Gaussian elimination. Even low-degree polynomials, e.g. an equation like x^4 + 51x^3 + x, can be solved efficiently using algebraic methods. However, the higher the degree of a polynomial, generally the harder it becomes to solve â€“ it can only be approximated by a larger and larger amount of linear functions.

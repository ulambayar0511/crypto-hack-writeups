 AES, like all good block ciphers, performs a "keyed permutation". This means that it maps every possible input block to a unique output block, with a key determining which permutation to perform.


 Using the same key, the permutation can be performed in reverse, mapping the output block back to the original input block. It is important that there is a one-to-one correspondence between input and output blocks, otherwise we wouldn't be able to rely on the ciphertext to decrypt back to the same plaintext we started with.

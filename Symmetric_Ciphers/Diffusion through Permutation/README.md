ShiftRows is the most simple transformation in AES. It keeps the first row of the state matrix the same. The second row is shifted over one column to the left, wrapping around. The third row is shifted two columns, the fourth row by three. Wikipedia puts it nicely: "the importance of this step is to avoid the columns being encrypted independently, in which case AES degenerates into four independent block ciphers."



MixColumns is more complex. It performs Matrix multiplication in Rijndael's Galois field between the columns of the state matrix and a preset matrix. Each single byte of each column therefore affects all the bytes of the resulting column. The implementation details are nuanced;

The Chinese Remainder Theorem gives a unique solution to a set of linear congruences if their moduli are coprime.

This means, that given a set of arbitrary integers ai, and pairwise coprime integers ni, such that the following linear congruences hold:



Note "pairwise coprime integers" means that if we have a set of integers {n1, n2, ..., ni}, all pairs of integers selected from the set are coprime: gcd(ni, nj) = 1.

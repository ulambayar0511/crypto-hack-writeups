 PEM is just a nice wrapper above DER encoded ASN.1. In some cases you may come across DER files directly; for instance many Windows utilities prefer to work with DER files by default. However, other tools expect PEM format and have difficulty importing a DER file, so it's good to know how to convert one format to another.

An SSL certificate is a crucial part of the modern web, binding a cryptographic key to details about an organisation. We'll cover more about these and PKI in the TLS category. Presented here is a DER-encoded x509 RSA certificate. Find the modulus of the certificate, giving your answer as a decimal.


- openssl x509 -in cert.der -out cert.pem
- openssl x509 -inform der -in 2048b-rsa-example-cert.der -text

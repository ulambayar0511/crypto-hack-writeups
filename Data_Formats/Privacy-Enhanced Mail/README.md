As we've seen in the encoding section, cryptography involves dealing with data in a wide variety of formats: big integers, raw bytes, hex strings and more. A few structured formats have been standardised to help send and receive cryptographic data. It helps to be able to recognise and manipulate these common data formats.

It wraps base64-encoded data by a one-line header and footer to indicate how to parse the data within. Perhaps unexpectedly, it's important for there to be the correct number of hyphens in the header and footer, otherwise cryptographic tools won't be able to recognise the file.
